Alright, thumb sucker, get your head out of your posterior and let's get to work. Here at Global Gym, we're better than you, and we know it. We're about turning that soft, squishy glob you call a body into a sculpted masterpiece. 

Start with basic stretching; touch those toes. No, your knees don't count. Now, I want you on the treadmill. Yeah, that big scary machine over there. Go as fast as you can until your lungs burn. If you're not panting like a dog in heat, then you're not doing it right.

Weights come next. I recommend something heavy, and no, your lunch doesn't count. Remember, pain is just weakness leaving the body... and also a sign you're doing it right. 

When you're finished crying over that, bite your lip and prepare for dodgeball drills. You're going to need reflexes of a mongoose and the grip strength of a Kung Fu master. If I see one hint of wincing or whimpering, you'll be doing twenty burpees on the spot.

We'll burn those love handles off, or you will die trying. Now, are you going to whine like a little baby or are you going to work? After all, you can't have a victory without first enduring the agony of de-feet. Now let's get it, chubby!
